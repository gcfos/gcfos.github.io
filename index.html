      <p>Modern Slavery is a sustainable development issue for cities and communities, which can impact upon multiple aspects of human flourishing including economic prosperity, health and wellbeing, education, climate action, decent work, and peace and justice.</p>
      <p>The significance of modern slavery as an international challenge is recognised in the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development target 8.7; to take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and eliminate the worst forms of child labour by 2030.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md">
      <p>This project is the first building block for a global slavery-free cities network, which can develop, scale and share sustainable approaches to achieving resilience against slavery.</p>
      <p>Using a two-year programme of knowledge-exchange we hope to accelerate and improve the development of place-based anti-slavery initiatives, by creating a structured dialogue on city-based anti-slavery action in diverse international contexts. Our network is funded by UK Research and Innovation via the Global Challenges Research Fund. </p>
