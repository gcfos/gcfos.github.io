    <div class="col-md-9 intro">
      <p>Nottingham in the UK is developing a multi-agency approach towards increasing resilience against modern slavery and human trafficking.  Multiple partners from statutory, private and voluntary sectors share the objective of making Nottingham and its surrounding County ‘slavery-free’.</p>
      <p>At the University of Nottingham’s Rights Lab we are supporting this aspiration by undertaking research to strengthen partnership working, clarify the nature and extent of exploitation in Nottinghamshire, and develop understanding of the factors that underpin anti-slavery resilience.</p>

      <p><b>Key areas of interest:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tackling criminal exploitation</li>
        <li>Addressing labour exploitation</li>
        <li>Developing slavery-free communities</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Hopes for the project:</b><br/>
          To better understand the factors that underpin resilience against modern slavery in different contexts.  To learn how other cities approach common challenges.</p>
