    <div class="col-md-9 intro">
      <p>Rio is Brazil’s second most populous city with approximately 6.7 million people.Local challenges include responding to new and emerging forms of urban exploitation; preventing labour abuses linked to informal employment practices and the need for greater legal clarification on child labour and sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p>Local projects include Cooperative Maravilha, which employs women residents in the Favela of Providência in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The Cooperative works in the garment sector, strengthening economic activity through social entrepreneurship, creating purpose, autonomy and income generation. We are supporting this aspiration with legal and educational support, alongside awareness raising on modern slavery.</p>
      <p>I-MiGRa – Migration, Gender and Race Institute is a civil society organization created with the premise of respecting human rights from a global South perspective. The objective is to fight multiple forms of human rights violations  through development of studies and projects in cooperation with public, private and civil society institutions, in order to create durable solutions in the field of Human Rights.</p>

      <p><b>Key areas of interest:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exploring how legal definitions drive policy responses</li>
        <li>Protecting informal workers and those at the periphery of society</li>
        <li>Strengthening city-level governance</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Hopes for the project:</b><br/>
          To better understand commonalities, differences between public policies implementation, civil society initiatives and factors that underpin resilience against modern slavery in different contexts.</p>
